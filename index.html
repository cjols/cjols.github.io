		<h2>Career Objective</h2>
	<p>Moving forward from my current place in education onto the enterprise stage, having goals to maintain and strive for gives me the strength to achieve greatness. Throughout my time as an undergraduate in Iowa Stateâ€™s computer engineering program, I have wanted to go on to program software for an automobile manufacturer. I supplemented this through my focus on software development and working with embedded systems. Looking further down my career path, it has always been a goal of mine to program artificial intelligence for self driving cars. I realize the amount of work that is required not only to reach this goal but also to work in the field. I am a predominantly intrinsically driven person, so it is imperative that I have goals that are closely aligned with my passions in order to contribute something to the automotive industry.</p>
