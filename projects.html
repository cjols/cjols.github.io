		<h2>Senior Design: GenA</h2>
        <p>
        Takes input as an XML file and converts to an Ada output file. Generates software through parsing the XML file for particular keywords and converts the library of keywords to Ada code. The files for the input and output had to be modular in order for the programmers who would be using this software at Collins Aerospace would be able to specify a tailorable configuration of the code format, language, and input/output file. A guided user interface was also made to supplement these configuration options.
        </p>
		<p>
		My role involving the team is as a core programmer who is coding the parsing and configuration module. I am also involved with the testing of the code library and tailoring features for this program. We will be completing this project in the spring, as it is fall, my team and I have yet to start working on various other core functionality of this application such as the software GUI.
		</p>
		<p>
		I feel like this is a very unique opportunity to get to work with code as bespoke as that which is used by Collins Aerospace. This project gave me real world experience as it provided me with an insight into the work I would be providing to a corporation, and what they would be providing me in terms of sources, feedback, and expectations. In terms of what technical skills I’ve gained, I would say I’ve gone above and beyond my past output for code production. This project took a ton of interpreting because it forced us to learn an obscure language, Ada 95 standard. This meant we learnt the language to the fullest extent as we were required to interpret various documents into a very specific language.Overall, working on this project for senior design gave me a lot of confidence for my future career. It allowed me to participate in genuine exchanges between a client and a project team

		In terms of what I have brought to this project in the overall sense, it remains up for interpretation by my client and my teammates, but I feel like I have been taught well these past few years at Iowa State. Not only to be the best programmer I can be, but also the best group member my teammates need me to be. A consistent hard worker who communicates thoughtful discussion, passionate changes, and operates within other group member’s expectations. I’m very proud of the work I provided for this project, as it ended my academic career on a high note.

		<h2>Coffee Cup</h2>
		<p>
		This Android app is my passion project that I made with a partner for computer engineering 388. This app makes finding the right recipe to brew the perfect cup of coffee a much more tangible experience. The idea behind this project is that it gives the coffee lover an organized log of what factors went into making a certain cup of coffee taste the way it did. By allowing the user to input water temperature and mass, coffee mass and bean type, grind size, and brew time, we can store the data into a log to compare and contrast past brews. After the user is finished enjoying the cup they just made, they can then evaluate the brew by entering ratings for extraction, strength, and enjoyment, along with descriptors for aroma and taste. The app then intelligently looks at the coffee recipe and the evaluation, and then, based off of coffee standard practices, recommends changes to the brew recipe to make sure your next cup of coffee is the best one yet. 
		</p>
		<p>
		My initial work on this project involved sketching the concept and features, while the majority of my time was spent on delivering front-end layouts and user interface flow for the different logs and views. The main point of experience that I took away from this project was structuring an app of this size from scratch. This app also allowed me the time to experiment with Android’s various importable objects to create something I never would have dreamed I had the capacity to build.

		<h2>Auto Solo</h2>
		<p>
		For this project, I used a program called Max, which can be explained as a programming language for electronic musical instruments. My main goal was to create a program that automatically generated a unique musical solo. This solo would be intelligently created by taking in tailorable factors such as defined scale structures, various forms, and a backing track to output a continuous, infinite melody. The main thing that I thought would make this stand out from other computer generated note structures is that it would have flowing lines and a user adjustable variation and speed.
		</p>
		<p>
		I created this program as a solo project my junior year for a music technology course. This means I was solely responsible for designing, structuring, programming, and testing this Auto Solo machine. As far as what I gained from this project, it certainly gave me an extensive taste of the Max 8 programming environment. I feel like the most substantial growth to my abilities as an engineer lies in how I translate this project to my other facets of programming. Designing and structuring this machine gave me insights into the creative process for designing and structuring more rudimentary software programs. The foundation of this project lies in the resources I had available to me, and I can owe the inspiration and encouragement I had to Professor Hopkins. I’m thankful for this resource in particular as this was made during a dark period in my college career.

		<h2>SGTC</h2>
		<p>
		This project was birthed from the dismay towards already available group management applications. The name of the project was given to what it was trying to accomplish, a combination of Slack, Git, and Trello, otherwise known as SlaGiTrelloCombo. Using Android SDK for the mobile application and PHP with the framework Laravel this project was born. The main deliverables for this project include a remote repository host, project scheduling, full feature chat, and group/member functionality. The main appeal for this application was the all-in-one feature set which meant everything was right at the groups fingertips.
		</p>
		<p>
		SGTC was made for my group's computer science 309 intern project. My particular role within the group was creating front-end user interface design for the web application. This was my first time doing this type of work and learning a new language, PHP, so I was thankful my group members were patient with my lack of experience. In addition to the front-end work, I was responsible for providing API structure for communication between back-end, the web application, and the android application.
		</p>
		<p>
		I learned a ton while working on this project because I was very much “thrown in the deep end” with the type of work I was tasked with. The most obvious advancement to my skill set was using git as version control within a team. Outside of git, I feel like I gained a lot of knowledge towards building and debugging web applications. Luckily, I didn’t have to go at this alone, as my team members were well experienced, especially the team member our group had working on the web application back-end. I utilized online coding tutorials to help me learn the basics of PHP, both these resources allowed me to succeed and come through for my group.
