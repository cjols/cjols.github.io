		<h2>Senior Design: GenA</h2>
        <p>
        	Takes input as an XML file and converts to an Ada output file. Generates software through parsing the XML file for particular keywords and converts the library of keywords to Ada code. The files for the input and output had to be modular in order for the programmers who would be using this software at Collins Aerospace would be able to specify a tailorable configuration of the code format, language, and input/output file. A guided user interface was also made to supplement these configuration options.
        </p>
		<p>
		My role involving the team is as a core programmer who is coding the parsing and configuration module. I am also involved with the testing of the code library and tailoring features for this program. We will be completing this project in the spring, as it is fall, my team and I have yet to start working on various other core functionality of this application such as the software GUI.
		</p>
		<p>
		I feel like this is a very unique opportunity to get to work with code as bespoke as that which is used by Collins Aerospace. This project gave me real world experience as it provided me with an insight into the work I would be providing to a corporation, and what they would be providing me in terms of sources, feedback, and expectations. In terms of what technical skills I’ve gained, I would say I’ve gone above and beyond my past output for code production. This project took a ton of interpreting because it forced us to learn an obscure language, Ada 95 standard. This meant we learnt the language to the fullest extent as we were required to interpret various documents into a very specific language.Overall, working on this project for senior design gave me a lot of confidence for my future career. It allowed me to participate in genuine exchanges between a client and a project team

		In terms of what I have brought to this project in the overall sense, it remains up for interpretation by my client and my teammates, but I feel like I have been taught well these past few years at Iowa State. Not only to be the best programmer I can be, but also the best group member my teammates need me to be. A consistent hard worker who communicates thoughtful discussion, passionate changes, and operates within other group member’s expectations. I’m very proud of the work I provided for this project, as it ended my academic career on a high note.
