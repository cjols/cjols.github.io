		<h2>Ethics</h2>
		<p>As a budding computer engineer who is representative of the next generation of 
		programmers to take the reins of an industry which leads the world in innovation. 
		With great power comes great responsibility, a responsibility to follow the ethical 
		standards set by the people whomst shoulders my generation stands on. Having the IEEE 
		ethical standard for everyone to follow serves a purpose beyond the sum of its parts. 
		To not simply just use it as a tool that the code of ethics is portrayed, but as to herald 
		it and band together to collectively enforce and abide by it serves to maintain a future 
		which remains stable and uncorrupt by actions which fall below the bar. For, without the 
		code of ethics, we allow the capitalist society we live in to eat itself with the vices 
		that serve to give it the power and strength to create the innovations that have led to 
		the world we live in today and our future. This is pertinent because we have been shown 
		time and time again the destabilizing power disregarding the code of ethics can take when 
		some person/company/organization fails to fulfill all of the rules it has set in place. 
		When faced with an ethical dilemma in my own work, it is important to use the checks and 
		balances of the code of ethics to make a decision regarding the right move to ensure that 
		I am not causing unnecessary or corrupt harm for my own or my company’s gain. Let that gain 
		be financial, political, or any other nefarious reason. Today, we use examples such as the 
		Ford pinto failure in the 1970s or the controversy with smart home devices such as the 
		Google Home or Amazon Alexa that is raging in modern times to show us what fire spreads if 
		we allow the spark of ethical failure to ignite. Thankfully, when surrounded by my fellow 
		graduating class, we tend to strongly agree with one another on the right stance to take 
		surrounding the issues presented to us. This is the most crucial part to code of ethics as 
		it serves to represent that as a single twig holding up the code we are weak, whereas, as a 
		bundle we are able to enforce on those which are set out to diminish the work by those who 
		have ethically come before us by using it for their own nefarious reasons. </p>

		<p>For me, the most important ethical virtues that are put forth are integrity, honesty, and
		responsibility. Integrity is important because it represents the person, as a unit of 
		consciousness, which has the ability to go against what they know is right. Having a strong 
		integrity means the person is sure of their decision so as to not deceive others. 
		Responsibility is the other side of the spectrum, as it doesn’t involve so much of the 
		individual, but the collective keeping others in check instead of taking a seat and watching
		the code of ethics crumble because they treated themselves as if they were not responsible 
		for helping. The most important ethic, in my opinion, is the virtue of honesty as it 
		transcends all other virtues as to be a means of right and wrong based on the human 
		consciousness. It is representative of every other virtue in itself. The other virtues of 
		fidelity, charity, and self-discipline are important, however, they lack the power to 
		completely corrupt or fix an ethical situation as single virtues. Together, they help add 
		branches to the tree of ethics to extend its reach beyond the individual and the 
		collective's honesty. As a whole, the IEEE code of ethics is complete and over complicating 
		it with added virtues may do more harm than good for the future generations of programmers 
		alike. It is of utmost importance to keep the ethics as concise and cohesive as possible or 
		else risking cracks in the fabric or loopholes to form. As important as being an innovative 
		and productive member of the engineering society is, following the code of ethics will 
		always come before trying to create a society more advanced than the current, as we all can 
		have both, but only if the ethics of every programmer shines through.</p>

		<h2>General Education</h2>
		<p></p>
		<h2>Cumulative Reflection</h2>
		<p>As the dawn of my academic career comes to a close, it’s important I take a step back from the stream of homeworks and exams to examine the lifelong lessons I can extract from the culmination of courses. This is done in recognition of the importance a perspective change can bring to the life of the individual. A perspective change which, administered at an important crossroad in one's life, can bring about tremendous change and positive outlook. </p>
		<p>One of the areas of my college academics that I feel has strengthened my person has been the gains I’ve gotten through learned problem solving techniques. A skill which I hold closely to my heart that I’ve learned in college is humbleness. What I mean by this is, never underestimate the knowledge of a person that is higher up than you, and ask questions thusly. Odds are, if you think that you know something, someone else is likely to know much more than you. In addition to the skill of humbleness, I feel that one tool that my engineering experience has given me is design thinking.</p>
		<p>Many courses along my college career I have given lectures on the topic of design thinking, but none as much and in depth as that of senior design. In senior design, we went over the many steps and outcomes of design thinking, which has completely changed my outlook on the process and made me think of it as a tool. As a team, we had to utilize design thinking in order to overcome the formative period of our project. Looking back on the class, the design thinking I’d learned throughout college and in senior design had given me the base we needed in order to get through the programming of our project.</p>
		<p>For me, the experiences I’ve had at Iowa State have all stressed the importance of lifelong learning. This is embodied in the outside resources that I’ve had to use in order to solve most engineering problems I’ve come across. To me, the most important resource I’ve found to help me solve problems has been friendship. I mean this in the sense that friendship can help create the environment necessary in order to grind a hard problem you’ve been stuck on throughout the night. Another resource which I found to have a great impact on my lifelong learning is getting a second or third source to teach the material. This can come in the form of a T.A., a friend, or the limitless sources online. In my experiences, sometimes I’ve had to take drastic steps in order to improve my knowledge on a topic I know I’m struggling with. To combat this, I’ve found that going into a professor’s office hours was a fantastic supplement to catch up on what needed to be learned. Back when I was taking embedded systems, as a team we had to create a roomba which could navigate a course using detectors on the unit relayed back to a host computer. During the programming and testing period, as a team, we used git for version control which I had learned from taking a class which focused on the fundamentals of git. Academics in college had taught me the importance of lifelong learning in order to be a functioning part and leader of a group.</p>
		<p>Being on the closing page of my academics has given me the opportunity to reflect on my past, successes and failures, mistakes and triumphs. The main aspect of myself that college has shown me is that learning is never something that concludes. Transitioning from college academics to a career, it’s important for me to create a plan for success and that plan revolves around improving my learning skills for the workplace that my career takes me. One thing in particular that I think I could improve on is my ability to read documentation as a means of learning material quickly. Sadly, as well as I work in a group, sometimes I won’t be able to rely on others to help me learn topics which I am struggling with. That is why lifelong learning is such a crucial aspect of what I take away from the experiences I’ve had in college.</p>
