		<h2>Ethics</h2>
		<p>As a budding computer engineer who is representative of the next generation of 
		programmers to take the reins of an industry which leads the world in innovation. 
		With great power comes great responsibility, a responsibility to follow the ethical 
		standards set by the people whomst shoulders my generation stands on. Having the IEEE 
		ethical standard for everyone to follow serves a purpose beyond the sum of its parts. 
		To not simply just use it as a tool that the code of ethics is portrayed, but as to herald 
		it and band together to collectively enforce and abide by it serves to maintain a future 
		which remains stable and uncorrupt by actions which fall below the bar. For, without the 
		code of ethics, we allow the capitalist society we live in to eat itself with the vices 
		that serve to give it the power and strength to create the innovations that have led to 
		the world we live in today and our future. This is pertinent because we have been shown 
		time and time again the destabilizing power disregarding the code of ethics can take when 
		some person/company/organization fails to fulfill all of the rules it has set in place. 
		When faced with an ethical dilemma in my own work, it is important to use the checks and 
		balances of the code of ethics to make a decision regarding the right move to ensure that 
		I am not causing unnecessary or corrupt harm for my own or my company’s gain. Let that gain 
		be financial, political, or any other nefarious reason. Today, we use examples such as the 
		Ford pinto failure in the 1970s or the controversy with smart home devices such as the 
		Google Home or Amazon Alexa that is raging in modern times to show us what fire spreads if 
		we allow the spark of ethical failure to ignite. Thankfully, when surrounded by my fellow 
		graduating class, we tend to strongly agree with one another on the right stance to take 
		surrounding the issues presented to us. This is the most crucial part to code of ethics as 
		it serves to represent that as a single twig holding up the code we are weak, whereas, as a 
		bundle we are able to enforce on those which are set out to diminish the work by those who 
		have ethically come before us by using it for their own nefarious reasons. </p>

		<p>For me, the most important ethical virtues that are put forth are integrity, honesty, and
		responsibility. Integrity is important because it represents the person, as a unit of 
		consciousness, which has the ability to go against what they know is right. Having a strong 
		integrity means the person is sure of their decision so as to not deceive others. 
		Responsibility is the other side of the spectrum, as it doesn’t involve so much of the 
		individual, but the collective keeping others in check instead of taking a seat and watching
		the code of ethics crumble because they treated themselves as if they were not responsible 
		for helping. The most important ethic, in my opinion, is the virtue of honesty as it 
		transcends all other virtues as to be a means of right and wrong based on the human 
		consciousness. It is representative of every other virtue in itself. The other virtues of 
		fidelity, charity, and self-discipline are important, however, they lack the power to 
		completely corrupt or fix an ethical situation as single virtues. Together, they help add 
		branches to the tree of ethics to extend its reach beyond the individual and the 
		collective's honesty. As a whole, the IEEE code of ethics is complete and over complicating 
		it with added virtues may do more harm than good for the future generations of programmers 
		alike. It is of utmost importance to keep the ethics as concise and cohesive as possible or 
		else risking cracks in the fabric or loopholes to form. As important as being an innovative 
		and productive member of the engineering society is, following the code of ethics will 
		always come before trying to create a society more advanced than the current, as we all can 
		have both, but only if the ethics of every programmer shines through.</p>
